# Memory Game Project
A project for the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree, developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. This game is often known as concentration, match or pairs.

## How to play
Flip over two cards at a time to find two cards that match. The deck consists of sixteen cards arrange randomly on the game board. Within the deck there are eight different pairs of cards, each with a different symbol.

+ Player clicks a card to reveal it's icon  
+ The play clicks another card to reveal another icon
+ If the cards match, both cards will turn green and stay flipped over
+ If the cards do not match they will flash red and flip back over

The game will end once all cards have been matched.
